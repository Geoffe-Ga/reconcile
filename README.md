**Reconcile is a platform for collaborative document editing that
creates opportunities for organizations to become "strange bedfellows"
and ally themselves toward whatever objectives they share.**

-   **Collaborators** (users) write their own personal Mission
     Statements.

-   They join **Organizations** and collaboratively create joint Mission
     Statements via a model for document editing resembling a
     democratic kind of open source Git version control.

-   Organizations **Reconcile** into umbrella entities known as
     **Coalitions**.

-   **Co-Creators** (followers) of Collaborators, Organizations and
     Coalitions receive notifications when those entities publish new
     or updated Documents.

The process for Document editing is:

1.  **View**: A Collaborator (user) accesses a document in an
     Organization they belong to. (like opening a file in the editor
     screen of GitHub)

2.  **Pitch**: The Collaborator presses \"Pitch new Atom\", edits a
     section and makes a Pitch (similar to a Pull Request) for changes

3.  **Discuss:** Debate in a temporary Channel, a Thread or on a
     Voice/Video Call, etc.

4.  **Vote**: All users of the Organization (who have opted in to
     participate) vote on the change

5.  **Update:** The Atom is updated (or not)

Organizations might be anything from Discord Servers, to Social
Movements, to Facebook Groups. They can Reconcile with each other to
create Coalitions that then have an overarching Mission Statement that
is a collaboration between both Organizations. This follows a View,
Pitch, Discuss, Vote, Reconcile flow very similar to Document editing.

A Collaborator, a Organization or a Coalition can all have Co-Creators
(followers) who receive emails/pings for:

1.  **New** Documents

2.  **Updates** to Documents

3.  **Pushes** - A notification instigated by a Collaborator for their personal Documents or by Pitch (to be voted on) from a Collaborator in a larger entity.

4.  **Votes** - Organizations and Coalitions only

The Document editing technology might be used for any number of
blog-like activities, from noodling about values and philosophy, to
drafting action roadmaps and outreach campaigns. It can then be blasted
to all Co-Creators as a way to organize group meet-ups, disseminate
voting strategy, call for help organizing, or whatever else.

In this way we create a map of reconcilable ontologies and recognize
that we each agree with every other person about something and
regardless of our differences, we can focus our attention and willpower
on collaborating on our shared values and objectives.
