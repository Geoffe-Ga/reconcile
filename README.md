**Reconcile is a platform for collaborative document editing that
creates opportunities for organizations to become "strange bedfellows"
and ally themselves toward whatever objectives they share.**

-   **Collaborators** (users) write their own personal Mission
     Statements.

-   They apply to **Reconcile** (Solo to Group) with **Organizations** and collaboratively create joint Mission
     Statements via a model for document editing resembling a
     democratic kind of open source Git version control.

-   Organizations **Reconcile** with one another (Group to Group) into umbrella entities known as
     **Coalitions**.

-   **Co-Creators** (followers/subscribers) of Collaborators, Organizations and
     Coalitions receive notifications when those entities publish new
     or updated Documents.

### Onboarding
- **Collaborators**: when a person first joins Reconcile,
  - they are asked to create their own personal Mission Statement, with optional help from an LLM
  - they are offered suggestions about Organizations to Reconcile with (Solo to Group) based on LLM analysis of their Mission Statement
- **Organizations**: when a Collaborator initializes Reconcile within an Organization (e.g. by installing the app on a Discord server),
  - The Collaborator who initiated the onboarding process creates a Mission Statements, again with optional help from an LLM, that is voted on by all Collaborators.
  - Reconcile creates places to view documents created by members of that Organization (e.g. a `#reconcile-docs` channel in Discord)
  - And a place for votes (e.g. a `#reconcile-votes` channel)
- **Coalitions**: When two organizations Reconcile with each other,
  - All Organizations involved in the Coalition are called on to create an overarching Mission Statement, with LLM help if desired.
  - Documents created by members of either Organization can be shared with the entire Coalition, if a vote passes, after which the new document will show up in all Organizations' `#reconcile-docs` channels.


### Document editing

1.  **View**: A Collaborator (user) accesses a document in an
     Organization they belong to. (Like opening a file in the editor
     screen of GitHub)

2.  **Propose**: The Collaborator presses \"Propose new Atom\", edits a
     section and makes a Proposal (similar to a Pull Request) for changes

3.  **Discuss:** Debate in a temporary Channel, a Thread or on a
     Voice/Video Call, etc.

4.  **Vote**: All users of the Organization (see Voting)

5.  **Update:** The Atom is updated (or not)

### Vote
- Occurs in multiple scenarios:
  - When a Collaborator attempts to Reconcile (Solo to Group) with an Organization
  - When a Collaborator starts a Organization to Organization Reconciliation to form a Coalition
  - When a Collaborator Proposes a new Document for an Organization
  - When a Collaborator Proposes changes to an existing Document
- Collaborators can opt in to receive notifications for participating in voting
- Votes can be one of [-2, -1, 0, +1, +2] to account for enthusiasm
- All open votes can be viewed in a dedicated location in any Reconcile Organization, (e.g. a `#reconcile-votes` channel) where ephemeral discussions can take place (e.g. in Discord Threads automatically generated beneath each vote by Reconcile.)

### Organizations and Coalitions
Organizations might be anything from Discord Servers for fans of a creator, to Social
Movements organizing on Slack, to Facebook Groups for local affinity meet-ups. They can Reconcile with each other to
create Coalitions, which triggers the generation of an overarching Mission Statement that
is a collaboration between both Collaborators belonging to both Organizations. This follows a View,
Pitch, Discuss, Vote, Reconcile flow very similar to Document editing.

### Notifications
A Collaborator, a Organization or a Coalition can all have Co-Creators
(followers) who receive emails/pings for:

1.  **New** Documents

2.  **Updates** to Documents

3.  **Pushes** - A notification instigated by a Collaborator for their personal Documents or by Pitch (to be voted on) from a Collaborator in a larger entity.

4.  **Votes** - Organizations and Coalitions only

### Use-Cases
The Document editing technology might be used for any number of
blog-like activities, from noodling about values and philosophy for an audience defined by lateral membership, to
drafting action roadmaps and outreach campaigns. It can then be blasted
to all Co-Creators as a way to organize group meet-ups, disseminate
voting strategy, call for help organizing, or whatever else.

In this way we create a map of reconcilable ontologies and recognize
that we each agree with every other person about something and
regardless of our differences, we can focus our attention and willpower
on collaborating on our shared values and objectives.
